# Custom

## Overview
A fully custom layout defined through a nested item tree structure. Unlike pre-built templates, this layout gives advanced users complete control to build any structure using combinations of flex, grid, sidebar, split, and stack layout containers. Users can create complex, multi-level layouts that precisely match their design requirements, making this the most powerful and flexible option for users who need layouts not covered by the pre-built templates. Can be used with or without a slide header.

## Visual Structure
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Structure is defined by user       │
│  using nested containers:           │
│                                     │
│  • Flex (horizontal/vertical)       │
│  • Grid (any dimensions)            │
│  • Sidebar (navigation patterns)    │
│  • Split (column divisions)         │
│  • Stack (layered content)          │
│                                     │
│  Can combine these in any           │
│  arrangement to create unique       │
│  layouts                            │

## When to Use
- Advanced layouts not covered by pre-built templates
- Complex multi-level structures with nested regions
- Custom grid arrangements (e.g., 4x3, 5x2, irregular grids)
- Mixed layout patterns combining multiple container types
- Brand-specific layouts that require precise structure
- Prototyping new layout patterns for future templates
- Slides requiring sophisticated content organization

## Content Recommendations

  - Complex nested structures with multiple levels
  - Mixed content types organized in custom arrangements
  - Brand-specific layouts with unique requirements
  - Multi-region layouts combining different container types
  - Content that requires precise spatial relationships
  - Advanced interactive components with custom layouts
