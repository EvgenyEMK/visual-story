# Grid 3+2

## Overview
A five-item grid layout with 3 items in the first row and 2 items in the second row. The top row contains three narrower cells while the bottom row contains two wider cells, creating a visual hierarchy where the top trio leads and the bottom pair provides a broader, more detailed view. This layout is ideal when three items are presented first as an overview, followed by two items that warrant more horizontal space. Can be used with or without a slide header.
