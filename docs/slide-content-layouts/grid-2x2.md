# Grid 2x2

## Overview
A layout featuring four equal quadrants arranged in a 2x2 grid (2 columns, 2 rows). This layout organizes content into four distinct cells, each receiving equal visual weight. Perfect for feature showcases, KPI dashboards, or any content that naturally divides into four related but distinct items. Can be used with or without a slide header.
