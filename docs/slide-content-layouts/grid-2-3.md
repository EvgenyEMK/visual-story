# Grid 2+3

## Overview
A five-item grid layout with 2 items in the first row and 3 items in the second row. The top row contains two wider cells while the bottom row contains three narrower cells, creating a visual hierarchy where the top pair is given more horizontal emphasis. This layout naturally suits content where two primary items lead, followed by three supporting or secondary items. Can be used with or without a slide header.

## When to Use
- Showcasing five features where two are primary and three are secondary
- Presenting a "hero pair" above with supporting details below
- Content that naturally groups as 2 + 3 (e.g., two main products + three add-ons)
- Five-step processes where the first two steps are broader and the last three are more specific
- Team or product showcases with exactly five items
- Any content with five items where the top two should appear more prominent

## Content Recommendations
- **Top Row (2 cells, each 50%)**:
  - Primary feature cards with larger visuals
  - Hero product images or key metrics
  - Main categories or themes
  - Highlighted items that deserve more space
- **Bottom Row (3 cells, each 33%)**:
  - Supporting feature cards or details
  - Secondary metrics or data points
  - Sub-categories or related items
  - Additional options or variations
  - Compact cards with icons and labels
