# Home Page

> **Status:** `planned`
> **MVP:** Yes

## Overview

The home page (landing page) is the first touchpoint for new visitors. It communicates the product value proposition, showcases example presentations, and drives sign-up conversions. The page must convey "Turn your script into animated presentations in minutes" through compelling visuals and a clear call-to-action.

## Planned Features

| Feature | Status | Summary |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Hero section | `planned` | Value proposition headline, subtitle, and primary CTA ("Try it free") |
| Demo showcase | `planned` | Interactive or auto-playing example presentations embedded on the page |
| Feature highlights | `planned` | Key capabilities (animations, voice sync, AI, interactive widgets) with visuals |
| Social proof | `planned` | Testimonials, user count, or case study previews (post-launch) |
| Footer & navigation | `planned` | Links to pricing, demo, docs, login/signup |

## User Flow

1. Visitor lands on home page (organic, ad, or referral)
2. Sees hero section with value proposition and example
3. Scrolls to explore feature highlights
4. Clicks "Try it free" → redirected to [auth/](../auth/) sign-up flow

## Dependencies

- [demo/](../demo/) — The demo experience may be embedded or linked from the home page
- [auth/](../auth/) — Sign-up flow for the primary CTA

## Notes

- Home page content and copy are TBD — this is a placeholder structure.
- SEO and performance (Core Web Vitals) are critical for this page.
