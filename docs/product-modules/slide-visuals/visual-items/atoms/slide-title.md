# SlideTitle

## What It Is
A heading component designed for prominent slide titles. Displays a main heading with an optional subtitle below it, providing clear visual hierarchy for slide content.

## Visual Appearance
The component displays a bold, high-contrast heading text in white with slight transparency. When a subtitle is present, it appears below the main heading in a smaller, lighter font. The text can be aligned to the left, center, or right. The heading uses a clean, modern sans-serif font with tight letter spacing for a professional look. Size presets range from small (for compact spaces) to extra-large (for hero sections).

## When to Use
- As the primary heading for slide content areas
- When you need a clear visual hierarchy with optional subtitle context
- For prominent announcements or key messages
- In combination with other content elements that need a strong title anchor
- When consistent heading styling across slides is important

## Configuration Options
- **Main text**: The primary heading text (required)
- **Subtitle**: Optional secondary text displayed below the main heading
- **Alignment**: Left, center, or right alignment for the text block
- **Size presets**: Small, medium, large, or extra-large sizing that scales both heading and subtitle proportionally
- **Entrance animation**: Optional animation effects when the component appears on screen

## Works Well With
- SlideText for body content below the title
- IconBadge when you need an icon alongside the title
- IconTitleCard and other card components that benefit from a clear heading
- TitleBar when used within the content area (not the header)
