# CTAButton

## What It Is
A call-to-action button component with a gradient background designed to prompt user interaction. Features customizable gradient colors and optional shimmer effects for attention.

## Visual Appearance
The component displays a rounded button with a customizable gradient background that transitions between two colors. The button text appears in white, bold font. When hovered, the button scales slightly for interactive feedback. An optional shimmer effect creates a subtle animated shine that sweeps across the button surface. The button scales through size presets for different use cases.
