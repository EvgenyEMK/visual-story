# SlideImage

## What It Is
An image component for displaying photos, illustrations, screenshots, and other visual content on slides. Provides flexible image sizing and fitting options.

## Visual Appearance
The component displays an image with configurable dimensions and border radius for rounded corners. The image can be fitted using three modes: cover (fills container, may crop), contain (shows full image, may have empty space), or fill (stretches to fill). The container can have rounded corners for a polished look, and the image scales smoothly with entrance animations.

## When to Use
- For displaying photos and illustrations
- When showing screenshots or UI mockups
- As background images or hero visuals
- In card layouts alongside text content
- For product images or feature demonstrations
- When you need consistent image presentation across slides

## Configuration Options
- **Image source**: URL or path to the image file (required)
- **Alt text**: Accessibility description for the image
- **Fit mode**: Cover (fill and crop), contain (show full image), or fill (stretch)
- **Border radius**: Adjustable corner rounding in pixels
- **Width**: Custom width (pixels or CSS value)
- **Height**: Custom height (pixels or CSS value)
- **Entrance animation**: Optional animation effects when the image appears

## Works Well With
- SlideText for captions and descriptions
- IconTitleCard for feature illustrations
- HeroSpotlight for hero section visuals
- GridOfCards when images are part of card content
