# HeroSpotlight

## What It Is
A large, centered component designed to showcase a single focused item with prominent visual emphasis. Features a large icon, title, and description in a centered layout, ideal for highlighting the active or featured item.

## Visual Appearance
The component displays a large icon badge with a gradient background and shadow effect, centered on the screen. Below the icon, a bold title appears, followed by an optional description text. The icon badge uses a gradient background tinted with the accent color and has a prominent border and shadow for depth. The entire component is centered both horizontally and vertically, creating a focal point for attention.
