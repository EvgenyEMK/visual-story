# QuoteBlock

## What It Is
A styled quotation component designed for displaying testimonials, key quotes, and emphasized text. Features decorative styling with serif typography and optional attribution.

## Visual Appearance
The component displays a quotation with a decorative accent bar at the top (a colored horizontal bar). The quote text appears in italic serif font for a classic quotation appearance, with generous line spacing for readability. An optional attribution line appears below the quote in smaller, non-italic text. The entire block has horizontal padding for comfortable reading. The component scales through size presets while maintaining the quotation styling.
