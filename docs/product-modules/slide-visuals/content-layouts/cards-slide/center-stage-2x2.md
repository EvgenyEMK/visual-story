# Center Stage (2×2)

## Overview
A centred layout displaying four content cards in a 2×2 grid — two rows of two — in the middle of the slide. Like Center Stage (2 Items) but doubled vertically, giving each card more horizontal space than the single-row Center Stage (4 Items) variant. The surrounding whitespace frames the four cards as a balanced quadrant. Can be used with or without a slide header.

## Visual Structure

## When to Use
- Presenting four key metrics or KPIs in a balanced 2×2 arrangement
- Four features, capabilities, or highlights when wider cards are preferred
- A quadrant overview (e.g. SWOT, 2×2 matrix)
- Four categories or comparison items that pair naturally into two rows
- Any slide where four items should share centre-stage focus with more room per card than a single row

## Content Recommendations
- **Card 1, Card 2, Card 3 & Card 4** (each):
  - Metric card with value, label, and optional delta
  - Feature card with icon, title, and short description
  - Quadrant item with heading and detail text
  - Product or plan summary
  - Compact comparison item with visual element
