# Reference Documentation

> **Parent module:** [Slide Editor](../README.md)

This folder contains data-model catalogs and technical reference documentation that is shared across multiple feature clusters. These docs describe **what exists** (animation types, visual item types, layout templates) rather than **what the user does** (which is in the feature cluster folders).

## Contents

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [animations/](./animations/) | Animation engine — element animations, grouped animations, slide transitions, trigger modes, theme system, full catalog |
| [visual-items/](./visual-items/) | Visual building blocks — atoms (text, icons, images), molecules (cards, lists), interactive layouts (hub-spoke, bento, etc.) |
| [content-layouts/](./content-layouts/) | Slide layout templates — columns, grids, cards, navigation patterns, slide header |
| [canvas/](./canvas/) | Technical specs for canvas components (SlideCanvas, element properties panel) |
