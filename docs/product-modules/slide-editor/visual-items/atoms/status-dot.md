# StatusDot

## What It Is
A small colored dot indicator used to show status, state, or presence. Provides a minimal, unobtrusive way to communicate status information through color coding.

## Visual Appearance
The component displays a small circular dot in a customizable color. The dot can pulse with a subtle animation effect for attention-grabbing status changes. An optional label can appear next to the dot in small text. The dot size is adjustable, and the pulse effect creates a subtle expanding ring animation around the dot.

## When to Use
- As status indicators in headers and navigation bars
- For online/offline presence indicators
- To show active/inactive states
- In card headers for quick status communication
- As part of status legends and key explanations
- When you need minimal visual footprint for status information

## Configuration Options
- **Color**: Custom color for the dot (defaults to green)
- **Label**: Optional text label displayed next to the dot
- **Pulse**: Toggle pulse animation for attention-grabbing status changes
- **Size**: Adjustable dot size in pixels
- **Entrance animation**: Optional animation effects when the dot appears
