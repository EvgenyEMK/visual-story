# IconBadge

## What It Is
A colored container that displays an icon (emoji, Lucide icon, or custom icon) inside a shaped badge. Provides visual emphasis and categorization through iconography and color coding.

## Visual Appearance
The component features a colored badge container with rounded corners that can be shaped as a circle, rounded rectangle, or square. The badge has a semi-transparent background tinted with the accent color and a subtle border. Inside, the icon is displayed at a proportional size. An optional label can appear below the badge in small text. The badge scales through size presets, maintaining proportional icon and label sizing.

## When to Use
- As feature icons in card layouts
- For category markers and visual categorization
- As visual accents that break up text-heavy content
- In icon grids or feature showcases
- For status indicators with iconography
- When you need consistent icon presentation with color coding
