/**
 * @visual-flow/shared
 *
 * Shared types, constants, and utilities used across the monorepo.
 *
 * When you start implementing API routes and the worker, move shared
 * domain types here from apps/web/src/types/ so both apps can import them:
 *
 *   import { Slide, Scene, Animation } from '@visual-flow/shared';
 *
 * Candidates for extraction:
 *   - apps/web/src/types/slide.ts
 *   - apps/web/src/types/scene.ts
 *   - apps/web/src/types/animation.ts
 *   - apps/web/src/types/project.ts
 *   - apps/web/src/types/ai.ts
 *   - apps/web/src/types/voice.ts
 *   - apps/web/src/types/billing.ts
 *   - apps/web/src/types/sharing.ts
